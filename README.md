# AnyProject

AnyProject is a prototype project for medical image analysis, allowing you to build highly custom project quickly based on it.

This project allows for custom transforms for medical image using MONAI. Check the example data/transforms.

For now, it cannot support multi-gpu distributed parallel training.
